- **Version Control**: Git, GitHub

## Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository

First, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cyberfortify/ai_reply_email_generator.git
```

### 2. Set up a Virtual Environment

It's recommended to use a virtual environment to avoid conflicts with other Python packages:

- Install virtualenv if you don't have it already:

```bash
pip install virtualenv
```

- Create a virtual environment:

```bash
virtualenv venv
```

- Activate the virtual environment:

  - On Windows:

  ```bash
  venv\Scripts\activate
  ```

  - On macOS/Linux:

  ```bash
  source venv/bin/activate
  ```

### 3. Install Dependencies

Install the required Python packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This will install Flask and the OpenAI Python client.

### 4. Set Up OpenAI API Key

You need to have an OpenAI API key to use this app. Obtain your API key from [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys).

- In the `app.py` file, replace the `openai.api_key` with your actual API key:

```python
openai.api_key = 'your-openai-api-key'
```

### 5. Run the Application

After setting up everything, you can run the application with the following command:

```bash
python app.py
```

The app will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` in your browser.

### 6. Use the Application

- Open your browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.
